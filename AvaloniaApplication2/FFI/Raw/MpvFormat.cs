     * Warning: although the encoding is usually UTF-8, this is not always the
     *          case. File tags often store strings in some legacy codepage,
     *          and even filenames don't necessarily have to be in UTF-8 (at
     *          least on Linux). If you pass the strings to code that requires
     *          valid UTF-8, you have to sanitize it in some way.
     *          On Windows, filenames are always UTF-8, and libmpv converts
     *          between UTF-8 and UTF-16 when using win32 API functions. See
     *          the "Encoding of filenames" section for details.

     *
     *     char *result = NULL;
     *     if (mpv_get_property(ctx, "property", MPV_FORMAT_STRING, &result) < 0)
